# Instradatore

**Instradatore** is a Python project designed to manage the execution of a sequential chain of Python and Bash scripts. Its goal is to simplify workflows by executing scripts in a predefined order, ensuring that dependencies and execution logic are respected.

---

## Features
- **Sequential execution:** Automatically runs Python and Bash scripts in order.
- **Configuration flexibility:** Define execution sequences in a configuration file.
- **Dependencies included:** Utilizes modern Python libraries like `pyyaml` and `rich-click` for enhanced functionality.
- **Support for NetCDF and HDF5:** Includes tools for handling scientific data with `xarray`, `netcdf4`, and `h5netcdf`.
- **Documentation-ready:** Bundled with `Sphinx` and themes for creating beautiful documentation.
- **HTML Report Generation:** Automatically generates an HTML report detailing the execution of scripts, providing insights into the workflow.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10** or later.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and project packaging.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fgr81/instradatore.git
   cd instradatore
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the Poetry virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Usage
1. Define the execution sequence in a `scripts.yaml` file.
   - Example `ames_34.yaml`

2. Run Instradatore using the following command, specifying any desired options or commands:
   ```bash
   python -m instradatore [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
   ```

   - **Available options:**
     - `--log TEXT`: Specify the log file location.
     - `--folder TEXT`: Define the folder where the chain will be saved.
     - `--daemon, -d`: Run in background mode.

   - **Available commands:**
     - `start`: Start the execution of the script chain.

## Development

### Adding Dependencies
To add a new dependency, use Poetry:
```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

### Generating Documentation
Instradatore uses **Sphinx** for documentation. To build the docs:
```bash
cd docs
sphinx-build -b html source/ build/
```
The output will be available in the `docs/build/` directory.
